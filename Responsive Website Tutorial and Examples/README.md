#Responsive Website Tutorial and Examples: Peer review 2
Instructions
You are to extend one of the two new examples - EITHER the collaborative drawing web app example OR the data visualisation website example, in order to produce a simple, yet usable, finished website. Your website must take advantage of dynamic content creation.

Your website must extend the example, adding data and features in the case of the data visualisation example, or adding collaborative drawing features in the case of the web application.

The site can have any number of pages as long as there is a clear purpose for each one. It must have the following features.

Clear navigation allowing the user to move between pages/ functions and to locate relevant information
Consistent style across the pages through use of CSS
Responsive layout where the layout changes depending on the size of the browser window.
Use of Bootstrap
Clearly stated purpose for each page.
Clear landing page (this might just be a special page that introduces the site, or some instructions)
ONLY If you are making the collaborative drawing app: it should allow the user to specify at least 16 colours, 3 drawing methods (e.g. different brushes, line thickness, or other style feature) and a save or export function.
ONLY If you are making a data visualisation app : it should use data from a different source (i.e. not the music data), visualise it in at least on three ways not covered in the example (using viz.js), and be interactive in some way.
