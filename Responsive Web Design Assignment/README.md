Instructions
In this peer assessment you will be making a web site that is created from data. We will provide you some JavaScript code that creates a complex data structure and you should create a website to display that data. You should use templates to display the data and the layout of your site should be appropriate to the data. You should provide suitable navigation and it should always be clear where users are, where they can go and what they can do.

Detailed instructions:

For this assessment you should create a data driven website that uses html, css, JavaScript and templates to display some data. This data will be some creative commons material taken from wikipedia about different animals.

You can find a zip file link below that contains everything you need to start.

Assignment.zip
The zip file contains the following:

the JavaScript and css libraries you might need (jquery, bootstrap, handlebars)
empty JavaScript and CSS files to put your code in
a HTML file with a head that imports the libraries, JavaScript and css files and an empty body to put your HTML code in
a JavaScript file called AnimalsData.js which creates a complex data structure that you will be displaying
AnimalsData.js contains a single variable called ¡°animals_data¡±. This variable is an object that contains an array called ¡°category¡±. Each element in the array represents a class of animals (reptiles, mammals, birds) and it contains a name and another array called ¡°animals¡± which contains objects representing species of animal. Each object has the following member variables:

name; the name of the species

description: a textual description of the species

image1: an image of an example of the species

image2: a second, alternative, image

You should create the following:

A HTML file containing the structures of your page, including templates designed to display the data
A JavaScript file that maps the data onto the templates and provides any interactivity
A CSS file that styles the web site (you may optionally use bootstrap).
The layout of the site should be appropriate to the data and display it in a clear and understandable way. It should provide suitable navigation functions and the overall layout and design should reflect the guidelines we have described in this MOOC.

You should submit a zip file containing everything you need to run the website, including the original data file, an html file, a css file and a JavaScript file, as well as any images and other files you need (including JavaScript libraries such as jquery, handlebars and bootstrap.
